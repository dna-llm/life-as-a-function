# Life as a Function

## Abstract 
Recent advances in generative models for nucleotide sequences have shown promise, but their
practical utility remains limited. In this study, we explore DNA as a complex functional represen-
tation of evolutionary processes and assess the ability of transformer-based models to capture this
complexity. Through experiments with both synthetic and real DNA sequences, we demonstrate
that current transformer architectures, particularly auto-regressive models relying on next-token
prediction, struggle to effectively learn the underlying biological functions. Our findings suggest
that these models face inherent limitations, that cannot be overcome with scale, highlighting the
need for alternative approaches that incorporate evolutionary constraints and structural informa-
tion. We propose potential future directions, including the integration of topological methods or
the switch of modeling paradigms, to enhance the generation of genomic sequences.
